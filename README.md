# Junimo Hut Analyzer

This applet helps you find a location for your junimo huts in Stardew Valley. Select your farm type, and it will generate a heat map of the best tiles to place the junimo hut based on the number of crops you can grow in that area. The mouseover tooltip will tell you specifically for that spot how many tiles can be farmed if you place the hut there. Darker red means more tiles, and the top 5% of tiles are marked in blue.
